## Background:
An operating system (OS) of an electronic device (e.g., smartphone) supports numerous third-party application software (applications) that a user may download through an application marketplace. A developer of the OS and/or an operator of an application marketplace (collectively “the OS developer”) may require developers of the third-party applications to follow various policies, terms, and conditions of the application marketplace, laws, regulations, ethical norms, and/or technical best practices intended to protect the user, the smartphone, and/or society at large (collectively referred herein as “policies”). Unfortunately, some third-party applications may intentionally and/or unintentionally fail to follow the application marketplace policies of the OS developer.

For example, a third-party application may be a “copycat” or an impersonation application of another third-party application or a first-party application. In such a case, a developer of the third-party application may intentionally mislead users by using an icon, description, title, and so forth similar to the other third-party application or the first-party application. In another example, a third-party application may contain and/or facilitate publishing of content in violation of the application marketplace policies. In yet another example, a third-party application may be a potentially harmful application (PHA). The PHA may be difficult to detect and may contain a virus, trojan, malware, and so forth intended to harm the user and/or the smartphone. Assume the third-party application appears to be an application valued by the user (e.g., a free video game). The video game, however, may contain malware that may utilize phishing to trick a user into revealing sensitive information, inappropriately exfiltrate data off the smartphone, conduct fraud (e.g., ransomware, billing fraud), use a messaging system to generate multiple unsolicited messages (“spam”), damage the smartphone (e.g., corrupt the OS), inappropriately use resources of the smartphone (e.g., processors), and/or conduct other harmful activities.
