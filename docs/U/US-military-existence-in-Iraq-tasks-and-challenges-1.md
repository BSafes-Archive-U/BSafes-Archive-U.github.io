## 1. Introduction
The direct military existence of the United States of America in many countries and regions of the world constitutes one of the tools of its global strategy since its emergence as an effective force in the international arena, and its soldiers and forces have spread in various countries in military bases, including permanent and temporary, and these forces are run by several leaders that specialize in each command in a specific region The number of US forces deployed around the world is estimated at 200,000. Of them between 60 and 70 thousand personnel in the Middle East region alone, and their existence is concentrated in several countries, including Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Israel and Djibouti, Tunisia, Morocco and Iraq.

As for Iraq, the US military existence in it has a specificity that differs from what exists in other countries in the Middle East, as this existence began after the US occupation of Iraq in April 2003 and passed through different stages dictated by the repercussions of the war on Iraq and the developments of security and political events that contributed to crystallizing the nature and size of this The existence from one stage to another, unlike the US military existence in the rest of the countries, which arose based on treaties and agreements between the United States of America and each of these countries separately according to the request of their governments and was not the result of the use of force and war as is the case in Iraq.

### The importance of study:
The importance of the study comes, whether in the conceptual or applied framework, which examines the importance of the American military presence on the one hand, and researches the implications of the American presence and withdrawal from Iraq, especially since Iraq is still fighting armed organizations. Non-state actors as well as in dealing with them, with the identification of the outputs that came with it and the impact of the role played by the United States of America towards issues, all these factors contributed in one way or another to the achievement of the strategic interests of America.

### The problematic point:
In this research, we try to develop an analytical framework on how to employ the ingredients and face the challenges in the stage of the American military presence in Iraq and the challenges that represented a major obstacle. There are a set of questions raised by the topic of research or trying to answer them:

  - How did the American military existence in Iraq emerge and develop?
  - What are its tasks and goals?
  - What are the challenges that he may face in the Iraqi arena? 

### Study’s hypothesis:
The research is based on the premise that the future presence of the American presence in Iraq is linked to the fate of international and regional events, as well as the American and Iraqi interior. The continuation of military performance is relative isolation in many global issues

##### Study’s Methodology:
The research relied on the induction approach for all the data that drive the American military presence in Iraq, and the descriptive approach was adopted to describe the components of American power, its sources, and its global role towards international issues based on it, down to the method of deduction in the ability of the American strategy in how to harmonize between goals and possibilities to achieve what it aspires to.

### Study’s Structure:
The research consists of an introduction, four demands, and a conclusion. It deals with the **first requirement** about the emergence and development of the US existence in Iraq as for the **second requirement**, it deals with US military bases in Iraq as for the **third requirement** Tasks and Goals As for the **fourth requirement** The challenges of the US military existence in Iraq

Through the answer, we will have given a clear picture of the US military existence in Iraq, through the following:
