## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

***  

Countries globally are heavily dependent on undersea communication cables which are run by commercial companies and tend to be neglected by national governments.

▶ **97% of global communications** are transmitted via these cables which are part of a network of an estimated 212 cable systems containing 750,000 miles of fiber. 

▶ **Satellite technology** is unable to handle modern digital economic and societal requirements. 

▶ Individual days may see **$10 trillion in financial transfers** by these cables and 15 trillion financial transactions processed. 

▶ **Undersea cables are also imperative for aviation and industries using cloud computing and artificial intelligence.**

▶ **Repairing these cables is a complicated process** requiring determining the location of the break using a built-in monitoring system, the owner contacting cable repair sites to assess damage, time needed to repair damage may range from hours or days with the average global repair time being 27 days in 2019. 

▶ In early August 2019, **India shut down Internet and phone service** in Jammu and Kashmir to deter opposition to legislation changing the status of these disputed regions. 

▶ **Within eleven days of this shutdown, shopkeepers were running short on vital supplies** such as baby food and insulin which were usually ordered online while also creating cash shortages and the inability to process credit. 

▶ Rupturing such lines **globally would produce cascading failures** immobilizing much of the international communications system and Internet for several weeks. Affected areas would include international finance, military logistics, medicine, commerce, agriculture, energy flows, food supply deliveries, and potentially produce a global depression.

These scenarios makes it imperative that the U.S. and its allies, and other international actors, enhance measures to ensure the security of undersea cables and severely punish those who would damage or destroy these critical infrastructures. This work strives to enhance awareness of the vital economic and national security significance of these critical infrastructures and makes recommendations to ensure their security and reliability against potential attempts by hostile powers like China and Russia or other national, transnational, and subnational entities to take steps to sabotage and destroy these cables with ruinous consequences for personal and international economics and security.<sup>1</sup>

> It is not the taking of individual ships or convoys…that strike down the money power of a nation; it is the possession of that overbearing power on the sea, which drives the enemy’s flag from it, or allows it to appear only as a fugitive…by controlling the great common, closes the highways by which commerce moves to and from the enemy’s shores. <sup>2</sup>
