## OVERVIEW AND HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION
This work provides historical and contemporary overviews of this critical geopolitical problem, describes the policy actors addressing this in the U.S. and selected other countries, and provides maps and information on many undersea cable work routes. These cables are chokepoints with one dictionary choke points as “a strategic narrow route providing passage through or to another region.”<sup>3</sup>

### FIRST TRANSOCEANIC CABLE LINE
Contemporary submarine cables began on July 29, 1858 when the HMS Agamemmon and USS Niagara met in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean joining over 1,000 miles of copper cable by lowering it to the sea floor and completing the world’s first Trans-Atlantic cable stretching from Ireland to Newfoundland. Queen Victoria and President James Buchanan exchanged telegrams on August 16, 1858 and their combined messages of less than 100 words, took 17 hours and 40 minutes to transmit representing the fastest message ever sent between Washington and London. Despite the involvement of U.S. and Royal Navy ships, this was a private sector owned and financed endeavor owned and financed by the Atlantic Telegraph Company created by New York businessman Cyrus West Field (1819-1892).<sup>4</sup>

Development of undersea cables would play a major role in enabling the British Empire to administer its dispersed dominions and respond to strategic contingencies<sup>6</sup> An 1859 U.S. State Department report on international commerce contains ample documentation of the economic significance of submarine cables in the United Kingdom and other countries.<sup>7</sup> In 1884, the Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables was signed by 40 different countries establishing the precedent that, “The breaking or injury of a submarine cable, done willfully or through culpable negligence, and resulting in the total or partial interruption or embarrassment of telegraphic communication, shall be a punishable offense, but the punishment inflicted shall be no bar to a civil action for damages.”<sup>8</sup> Evidence of the increasing importance of undersea cables in British imperial policymaking was reflected in the 1885 Submarine Telegraph Act, which imposed a maximum criminal penalty of five years imprisonment for anyone intentionally attempting to break or injure an undersea cable and up to three months imprisonment and a maximum fine of £100 ($486) ($14,300 in 2021) if these cables were damaged by culpable negligence.<sup>9</sup>

The 1958 Geneva Convention on High Seas enacted the legal principle that nation states could not obstruct undersea cable construction in international waters in Articles 2 and 26.<sup>10</sup> The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) aspires to be the preeminent international legal instrument on oceans. It consists of 167 members and Articles 112-115 cover undersea cables. Article 112 says countries are entitled to lay such cables and pipelines on the bed of high seas beyond the continental shelf. Article 113 enables countries to enact laws criminalizing the breaking of undersea cables by vessels of their own countries, but does not give warships the right to board vessels suspected of intentionally attempting to damage undersea cables in international waters, making it difficult for naval powers to deter hostile vessels from such activity. Article 114 allows each country whose cables or pipelines are broken to compel the perpetrator to pay repair costs and Article 115 gives countries authority to adopt laws and regulations to sacrifice anchors or fishing gear to avoid injuring cables to be indemnified if they take all reasonable precautionary measures. UNCLOS provisions also fail to account for the emergence of fiber optical cables in the late 1980s, which have become predominant over satellites in international cable transmission. During 2012 congressional testimony, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted that satellites could carry no more than 7% of U.S. voice and data traffic further illustrating the critical importance of undersea cables in international economic, legal, and strategic policymaking. <sup>11</sup>

The United States is one country which has not ratified UNCLOS despite efforts of presidential administrations of both parties and some elements within Congress and international affairs organizations to achieve this goal. Understandable reasons for U.S. refusal to ratify UNCLOS include U.S. membership not providing maritime rights or freedoms the U.S. already enjoys and that maintaining a strong U.S. Navy is the best way for the U.S. to maintain its rights. The U.S. already has a legal framework through domestic law and bilateral agreements for deep seabed mining and should not subject U.S. companies to the edicts of an unaccountable international bureaucracy forcing them to pay excessive fees to the International Seabed Authority for redistribution to developing countries. The U.S. is a sovereign nation and does not need an UN-based commission’s approval to access gas and oil resources in the U.S. continental shelf. Royalties the U.S. retains for natural resource extraction should only be used to benefit the American public; resources the U.S. needs to access on its extended continental shelf can be negotiated through bilateral treaties with adjacent countries. Acceding to UNCLOS would expose the U.S. to climate change lawsuits and other litigation brought by UNCLOS members, which would harm U.S. economic, environmental, and military interests; and the U.S. has successfully defended its Arctic interests since acquiring Alaska in 1867 and since UNCLOS’ establishment. The U.S. gains nothing from ratifying UNCLOS.<sup>12</sup>

### TECHNOLOGIE S INVOLVED INCLUDING PATENTS
Before discussing geopolitical implications of undersea cables, it is helpful to look at the multiple technological factors involved in creating this network covering the world’s circumference. Installing these cables is a highly professional skill requiring technologies such as automatic control, communication, and navigation. Required equipment for submarine cable installation includes a cable ship, jointing and testing equipment, and underwater installation equipment. Cable ship infrastructure includes drum cable machines, linear cable machines for laying cable, submarine optical cable storage tanks, professional installation machines, and control management software. During the 1960s and 1970s submarine coaxial communication cable development into the main methods of transoceanic communication. Submarine cable curvature radius usually exceeds one meter and a radius of 1.5 meters is required to ensure submarine communication cable and repeater safety between the pulley group design and ship stern during the laying process.<sup>13</sup>

Submarine optical cable technology has experienced exponential development in subsequent decades including reaching weights of over 10,000 tons, using drum-type and linear machine laying equipment. Making greater use of Internet technology to facilitate installation and remote management, using burial machines weighing between 5-15 tons to bury cables one meter below the ocean floor, and the increasing use of remote operating vehicles to carry out cable installation. This technological development has resulted in increased interconnectivity, which can be susceptible to physical and cyber-attacks.<sup>14</sup>

The following pictures of patents and photographs of undersea cables document their physical appearance and illustrate the factors involved in installing these objects globally.

### ORGANIZ ATION OF UNDERSE A CABLES
Undersea cables are produced and owned by private companies representing individual countries, multinational consortia, and some national governments. These cables transmit most international voice and data traffic including military, government, emergency response, air traffic, subway, rail, and port traffic. Stephen Malphrus, a former Chief of Staff to former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke noted, “When communication networks go down, the financial service sector does not grind to a halt, rather it snaps to a halt.” These cables are part of a global network containing 750,000 miles of fiber and recent destruction of cables has had international repercussions. There have been exponential increases in the speed of these over 160 years with a 2019 transatlantic transfer by the company Infinera achieving a speed of 2.62 terabits per second or 4.8 million high definition movies simultaneously. Cables cost $200- $500 million to build with some cables being on top of the ocean floor in deep seas, those crossing shallower continental shelf waters are armored and buried one to two meters below the seafloor to protect them from damaging activities.<sup>17</sup>

Recent years have seen natural and human caused events result in temporary disruption of undersea cables. On December 26, 2006, a series of earthquakes off Taiwan’s southwest coast produced undersea landslides in the Luzon Strait severing six of seven undersea cables distributing Internet and phone services from North America to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea. Taiwan’s largest telecommunications operator Chungwa Telecom reported 100% Internet outage to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, trading of the Korean won halted in Seoul, 80% of Hong Kong’s communications capacity was wiped out in minutes, and Asia’s most important financial center had to rely on a SINGLE cable to transfer billions of dollars in trades and transfers globally. It took 11 ships 49 days to finish repairs.<sup>18</sup>

Another example of disruption to undersea cables and its civil and military implications was reflected by the inadvertent December 2008 cutting of three undersea cables connecting Italy and Egypt. This knocked out 80% of connectivity between Europe and the Middle East. Pakistan lost 70% of its Internet connectivity and India lost between 50-60% of its westbound connectivity. This was particularly problematic for the U.S. and British militaries, which had 200,000 troops in Iraq at that time and relied on commercial cable networks for 95% of their strategic communications. U.S. Air Force Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) were heavily used in counter-terrorism operations in Iraq and Pakistan. These assets are remotely piloted from Europe and the U.S. requiring 500 MBs bandwidth to operate, which cannot be achieved without a strong undersea cable network. Lieutenant Colonel Donald Fielded off the 50th US Communications Squadron stressed that these cable breaks caused UAV flights originating from Iraq’s Balad Air Force Base to fall from hundreds of daily combat sorties to “tens.” During its 2014 conquest of Crimea, Russia made extensive use of hybrid warfare to seize control of the peninsula’s Internet infrastructure, control the information flow, and portray its actions as legitimate. Russian Special Forces only need to secure an Internet exchange point at Simferopol to cut connections to the rest of Ukraine.<sup>19</sup>
