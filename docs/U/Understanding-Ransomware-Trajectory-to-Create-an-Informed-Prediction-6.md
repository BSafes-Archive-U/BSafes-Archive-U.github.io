## VI. DEFENSE OVERVIEW
After reading all about the innovations of attack, ransomware defense is understandably not an easy task, but significant money and energy is being invested in putting an end to ransomware. Academic researchers, government agencies, and private cybersecurity firms all want to help. Even though ransomware attacks are criminal, law enforcement agencies have not historically been equipped to deal with this new kind of crime, in fact they get ransomed too. International attacks don’t really fall under any country’s legal jurisdiction, so a lot of the responsibility has fallen to researchers trying to keep up with cybercriminals in real time. Ultimately, up to now the burden of stemming the flow of ransomware attacks has fallen to cybersecurity experts.

So how do researchers go about such a monolithic task? Researchers study how ransomware operates then create models from which they devise countermeasures. Ransomware is an underground black market, therefore reputable information is hard to come by. Defending against an unknown threat is near impossible because defenders are working from incomplete information. The more complete cyber security experts’ understanding of ransomware attacks, the better equipped they are to thwart those attacks [6]. Once models are created to describe how ransomware attacks work, then researchers can begin to counter those attacks. Without the models they wouldn’t know where to start. Essentially, researchers have to witness ransomware attacks to learn how to react to them.

Thankfully, academic researchers and professional experts have been working together to construct generic models of ransomware attack methods. One such model, created by American not-for-profit, government funded cybersecurity research corporation MITRE, exists to

> "create a comprehensive list of known adversary tactics and techniques used during a cyberattack. Open to government, education, and commercial organizations, it should be able to collect a wide, and hopefully exhaustive, range of attack stages and sequences. MITRE ATT&CK is intended to create a standard taxonomy to make communications between organizations more specific."

Breakthroughs in defenders’ understanding of attack techniques have made leaps and bounds in recent years, proving the hypothesis that progress can be made when adequate resources are allocated. For example, in 2019 David Lu, a security researcher and PSU professor, authored a corporate blog post arguing that MITRE ATT&CK is “tremendously valuable [...] to better communicate, collaborate, account for, and reason about the domain in a scientific manner”, but at the time the model is inadequately organized and in need of structural improvements [32]. In 2020 MITRE ATT&CK introduced sub-categories to resolve the issues present in the previous iteration of the model. Just one year after Lu’s call to action he posted another article praising MITRE for their improvements, stating that the newer model is more usable and provides finer detail [33]. This is a clear example of the collaborative ransomware defense ecosystem rising to the challenge of working to enable iterative improvements quickly. As attack models are fine tuned and updated, ransomware defense trends towards increased security.

Thankfully MITRE is just one of many groups pushing for accurate ransomware models. Efforts from academic researchers have resulted in the creation of Randep, a model of the Windows API functions called by ransomware samples, useful for classifying and predicting ransomware behavior [6]. Private entities have also found success when partnering with academic researchers. A 2018 paper by Google and Chainalysis partnered with University of California San Diego, New York University, and Princeton University, performed the difficult work of tracking ransom payments through the once-anonymous Bitcoin blockchain to construct a model of the ransomware attacker ecosystem [5]. These groups of talented, driven, and bright individuals along with many other groups like them, are working to establish consistent methodologies so our understanding of ransomware attack, and therefore capability to implement ransomware defense, is trending upwards.

Once an understanding of ransomware attacks is established then security experts can begin implementing defenses. Most often this comes in the form of a downloadable tool for your computer, but also includes user education, online resources for victims, and law enforcement response. There are three general approaches to ransomware defense taken by cybersecurity experts. Recovery, meaning the victim is able to fully recover from an attack without paying the ransom. Detection, meaning the attack is detected as it’s happening and defended against. Lastly prevention, meaning the attack is proactively mitigated before any damage can be done to the victim’s system. In this section I will investigate how ransomware defense has changed over time to inform predictions about ransomware defense in the future.

### *A. Recovery*
Recovery is the most passive defense approach to ransomware defense, based on the idea that the victim is able to regain access to their stolen valuables without paying the ransom. Historically, the cybersecurity community has been willing to invest ample time and energy into ransomware detection and prevention, but less attention is given to methods to recover the stolen files after infection [34]. A variety of techniques exist to help victims recover from successful attacks, ranging from decryption to key escrow systems to simple backups.

Backups offer a straightforward and effective solution to the ransomware threat by providing a recovery point for a victim’s system, therefore files can be retrieved without paying a ransom. Although no silver bullet exists that can defeat all forms of ransomware, backups are the closest thing users can get. Keeping a separate copy of the data being ransomed effectively removes all bargaining power from the attacker. Additionally, users that regularly backup their data enjoy peace of mind because they have little reason to fear an attack. Unfortunately, despite the widespread availability of backup technology, many home users haven’t implemented an effective backup strategy to successfully recover from a ransomware attack. According to a 2015 survey 25% of home users had never backed up files at home, while 55% backed up some but not all of their files at home. This unsettling statistic indicates that the majority of home users are exposed, to some degree, to ransomware attacks. Additionally, only 25% of home users backed up files at least once a week, meaning that 75% of home users would lose more than a week’s worth of files in the event of a ransomware attack [7]. The lack of backups can likely be attributed to a lack of user awareness and education. Therefore, increasing users’ understanding of the importance of backups, which ultimately leads to a change in user behavior, represents a trend towards greater recovery rates. Alternatively, decreasing the knowledge or effort required of users to create reliable backups has the same desirable result.

In the early days of ransomware attackers used symmetric encryption, the more basic type of encryption that requires the same key to encrypt and decrypt data [35]. Symmetric encryption is quick to implement but is inherently simple to reverse, so it didn’t take long for cybersecurity experts to reverse engineer the malware and provide decryption tools [7]. The first generation of crypto ransomwares were easily thwarted because cybercriminals’ techniques were outmatched by those of cybersecurity experts. However, as Yung and Young had predicted, ransomware techniques improved to leverage asymmetric encryption, the more complex type of encryption that uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt data. This development hampered researchers’ decryption efforts dramatically, but decryption tools were still being published. Oftentimes, once a cybersecurity expert discovers a method of decrypting files damaged by a particular sample of ransomware they’ll publish the method online for victims to use.

Utilizing asymmetric encryption made file recovery much more difficult, but researchers have identified a method for recovery from ransomware infections on Windows systems. This method relies on a common weakness in ransomware implementation and the capability of Windows to create shadow copies. Shadow copies are backup copies of the user’s system that are saved at regular intervals so in the event of a system failure you can restore the system to a recovery checkpoint [7]. Unfortunately for victims, later generation ransomware samples are advanced enough to delete shadow copies during their attacks, leaving no restoration points with which to recover. Fortunately for victims, according to a 2016 study users can prevent the four most common crypto-ransomwares from deleting their shadow copies by renaming the system tool that handles shadow copies [34]. The researchers used this finding to produce a script that automatically renames the appropriate tool. Once a user has run the script their computer is effectively capable of recovering from a ransomware attack via restoration to a state prior to encryption [34]. A technique that was once a cybercriminal innovation has since been entirely mitigated by researchers in a way that reduces the knowledge demanded of users, further evidence of a trend towards more ransomware recoveries.

Another recovery method is a key escrow system that involves storing recent encryption keys in a secure vault to be used for decryption. In the event of a successful ransomware attack the user’s key vault captures the encryption key, making file recovery via decryption a trivial task. One such tool called PayBreak was published in 2017 by a team of researchers in collaboration with MITRE. PayBreak continually monitors the integrity of files on the user’s computer, keeping an eye out for telltale ransomware behavior. Since most ransomware attacks rely on cryptography tools in the computer’s operating system, PayBreak can reference attack models to know which function calls are suspicious, then store encryption keys as encryption occurs [35]. PayBreak was tested with 107 ransomware samples spanning twelve ransomware families, including two of the most financially devastating families of 2016, and demonstrated 100% file recovery for each attack, effectively defeating the threat of cryptographic ransomware [35]. Although ransomware attackers could change their techniques to evade PayBreak, for example writing their own cryptographic functions rather than using what’s available, this tool significantly increases the effort required to pull off an unrecoverable attack. PayBreak eliminates the threat from a huge group of ransomware samples and in doing so forces attackers to employ new and challenging techniques that most have avoided. Best of all, PayBreak’s source code was published in 2017 and the tool is freely available to the public [35].

Ransomware recovery methods are steadily improving as defenders develop a stronger understanding of their adversary. System and file backups offer the simplest solution, but a disappointing proportion of Internet users neglect to take this step. In response security experts raise awareness of their importance and computer manufacturers implement automatic backups. When ransomware attackers began targeting the shadow copies researchers found a way to counteract that, simplified the setup, and released it to the public. Alongside that specific remedy, defenders created a more robust defense that covers a wide variety of ransomware variants and isn't easily overcome. This tool, PayBreak, was released to the public free of charge too. Recovery may be a last resort in the domain of ransomware defense, but its ability to help victimized users and keep money out of cybercriminals’ pockets is profound. As the proportion of infections that result in recovery rather than ransom increases, the battle against ransomware swings in the direction of defense.

### *B. Detection*
Detection is the oldest approach to ransomware defense, founded on the idea of observing and halting an attack as it happens, greatly reducing the need for recovery efforts. Researchers have established two main methods of attack detection; analyzing the behavior of the computer system to identify anomalies, and luring the ransomware into attacking a decoy file. Both techniques require an accurate and detailed model of ransomware attack techniques to work properly. Behavioral analysis requires an understanding of ransomware encryption patterns to recognize the attack quickly, and decoy files work best with an understanding of how ransomware prioritizes which files it targets. With improvements in attack modeling come improvements in detection techniques as defenders have more information at their disposal. This causal relationship is best illustrated by the newfound capability of detection tools to identify unfamiliar ransomware samples [36]. Additionally, detection’s upward trend is evidenced by the decreasing time between infection and detection, and the existence of mitigation strategies for ransomware that’s yet to exist [18, 37].

Decoy files are one of the simplest techniques for detecting ransomware attacks. They operate by lying in wait alongside the user’s other files and raising a red alarm when they’re disturbed, similar to a landmine [18]. Because these files are not intended to be accessed by the user any file activity is assumed to be a ransomware attack. The effectiveness of decoy files as a deception-based detection technique is reliant on the ransomware’s willingness to encrypt a decoy file. As such, researchers study methods to minimize the damage an attack renders to a system before being halted.

In 2017 a team of researchers reverse engineered eleven distinct ransomware samples to understand how they traverse a victim’s file system and found that every sample sorted files alphabetically [37]. Based on their research of existing ransomware they developed a defense technique, and even went one step further by developing defense techniques based on their predictions of alternative ordering methods future ransomware authors may use to evade deception-based defenses. To defeat current, decoy-blind ransomware they propose naming decoy files such that they are encrypted first when sorting alphabetically. To defeat future ransomware, which may order files by file size or access time, they propose methods of prioritizing decoy files based on file size and access time. To defeat future ransomware that orders files randomly they propose utilizing a greater quantity of decoy files which statistically results in faster attack detection. Not only did this research team identify methods to mitigate known threats, they also thought several steps ahead in the battle against ransomware authors.

In a 2020 PhD dissertation author Genc takes a hard look at existing deception-based anti-ransomware systems and identifies multiple weaknesses that could be exploited by current decoy-blind and future decoy-aware ransomware. Interestingly, the existence of such decoy-aware ransomware is purely speculative, therefore Genc is identifying a weakness in current defenses and predicting how attackers may take advantage of that. Based on an in-depth literature review of deception-based defense tools, Genc provides advice on which decoy techniques to abandon because they’re too easily evaded, and best practices on how to improve current techniques for greater effectiveness against decoy-aware ransomware.

Consider that deception-based detection techniques were first published in 2016, and by 2017 researchers were optimizing their techniques for decoy-blind ransomware, then by 2020 there were strategies that would mitigate attacks from decoy-aware ransomware. Every step of the way, defenders are staying a few steps ahead, working from an understanding of how future ransomware samples will likely operate to mitigate ransomware authors’ inherent head start.

Behavioral analysis is another technique for detecting ransomware attacks, this one based on continuously observing system behavior and watching for telltale signs of ransomware. Because ransomware usually tries to encrypt many files quickly, detection tools can identify that an attack has begun when certain aspects of the victim’s system become significantly more active [18]. In fact, in 2018 the median time required for ransomware to encrypt an entire file system was only 7.8 minutes [5]. The system behavior observed may include frequency of file system access, frequency of encryption, network connections, and which OS functions are being called, all metrics that will be characteristically affected by active ransomware [9]. When a process begins acting suspicious an automated security tool can terminate it immediately, preventing further damage [18].

Behavioral analysis was the first researched detection technique, pioneered in 2015 by Kharraz et al, and as such has served as a foundational technique of ransomware detection. Kharraz et al. closely studied how existing ransomware manipulates the victim’s file system and discovered that the system’s input and output requests could be monitored to successfully detect an ongoing attack [19]. This discovery represented a major leap forward in defense capabilities and researchers have been fine tuning the technique ever since.

Later that year HelDroid was published, a security tool that detects ransomware attacks on Android mobile phones [36]. Rather than monitoring the file system for anomalous behavior, HelDroid detects apps that are secretly attempting to lock or encrypt the device [36]. Along with a robust mobile device security tool capable of detecting unknown ransomware samples with nearly zero false-positives, the study also contained common characteristics of mobile ransomware [36].

Another such tool is the Pre-Encryption Detection Algorithm (PEDA) developed by Kok et al. and published in 2020. PEDA builds upon previous detection and prevention research to leverage a two layer detection system capable of identifying known and unknown ransomware [9]. The behavioral analysis layer works using a machine learning model trained on the OS function calls made by the potential ransomware sample. All system calls are recorded until a call to an encryption function is made, at which point the list of extracted calls is fed into the machine learning model to produce the prediction [9]. In order to collect the system calls made without jeopardizing the user’s system, PEDA executes the ransomware sample in a secure virtual environment known as a sandbox. To accommodate this paradigm users must manually submit a file to PEDA for ransomware analysis. PEDA is a particularly advanced detection tool capable of detecting ransomware without requiring damage to the user’s files, but its general effectiveness is limited by the high computing cost of running a sandbox. PEDA boasts a 10-fold cross-validation recall score of 99.9% proving to be a robust detection system, but more importantly the study identified three system calls used by most ransomware [9]. These three system calls have certainly been incorporated into ransomware models and will continue to inform defense tool developers for years to come.

Ransomware attack detection is undeniably improving. Not only can security tools detect attacks faster than ever before, they can even recognize attacks from never-before-seen ransomware samples [36]. In special cases security tools can even detect ransomware without risking system damage [9]. However, detection as a defense paradigm is inherently reactive, which is not ideal because the victim must incur some system damage. Attack detection is certainly helpful for minimizing losses and it’s better than relying solely on recovery, but it still requires that the ransomware infects the user’s system before defenses are enacted. Detection tools essentially limit damage, and they’ve been allowing less and less damage, but can security tools entirely prevent attacks?

### *C. Prevention*
Prevention is the newest approach to ransomware defense, predicated on the goal of defeating ransomware before it can even attack. There are many approaches to ransomware prevention, ranging from technical prevention to widespread user education to international law enforcement. Cybersecurity researchers would love to be able to prevent system damage aso they have found ways to prevent infection and prevent encryption. Internet users would love to be able to have peace of mind and not pay ransoms therefore user education resources are plentiful. Governments would love to minimize the financial burden of criminal activity on their citizens so they have begun targeting cybercriminal organizations and placing hefty sanctions on ransomware strongholds. Recovery and detection are invaluable in the domain of ransomware defense, but prevention is the gold standard. Thankfully the challenge of ransomware prevention is becoming increasingly realistic and feasible.

Despite the successful development of reactive defense tools, security researchers were aware that defense could still be improved, so some set out to create a system that operates proactively. Their solution was binary analysis, a technique in which the contents of the code in a file are searched for cryptographic operations and compared against known ransomware. Recall that the code responsible for ransomware behavior comes in the form of a binary file, hence the name binary analysis.

In the previous section I discussed the detection layer of PEDA, now I’ll discuss the prevention layer of PEDA. PEDA implements binary analysis by first hashing the binary, producing a hash signature. In cryptography hashing is a mathematical one-way function that accepts a file and produces a character signature unique to the file contents [9]. The signature is then compared against a repository of known ransomware signatures. A match here indicates the file is a known ransomware, at which point the user is made aware and the file is quarantined [9]. The binary analysis layer executes prior to the detection layer because identifying a known ransomware sample eliminates the need to interpret the system calls, the attack has already been prevented. If the hash isn’t recognized, and then the detection layer classifies the file as ransomware, then the signature is added to the repository of known ransomware signatures. This self updating system helps to keep the repository of known ransomware signatures current. Binary analysis is fast and efficient, but lacks the ability to identify unknown ransomwares and therefore cannot prevent their attacks. However, since most ransomware attacks stem from a small number of ransomware families, binary analysis goes a long way towards preventing most attacks. Where once users were completely vulnerable, we now have a technique that can prevent damage from ransomware that’s been seen before. This is a massive step in the right direction, but emerging cybercriminal techniques such as obfuscation of the binary may allow attacks to slip by unprevented [18]. To counter this never ending battle researchers continue to anticipate cybercriminal innovations by developing innovations of their own.

Whereas binary analysis prevents a ransomware infection, innovative methods continuously emerge that prevent ransomware encryption. In 2019 a team of researchers developed a novel method that prevents file encryption by randomly and continuously changing file extensions that the ransomware tries to encrypt [31]. The authors refer to this as the Moving Target Defense method and claim it can prevent encryption despite changes in attack techniques because it provides protection at such a fundamental level [31]. When tested against ransomware samples from four families the tool was able to protect important files from 99% of the samples, all while maintaining a small computational footprint, meaning no noticeable performance degradation [31]. The widespread adoption of a tool this robust would put a huge dent in ransomware attackers’ profits, and the development of such a tool represents a positive trend in ransomware prevention. Another example of prevention innovation is a tool published in 2020 called NoCry which prevents encryption by controlling which programs have access to OS cryptography functions [18]. Rather than monitoring these function calls and detecting suspicious encryption patterns, NoCry only allows trustworthy programs to use the functions necessary for encrypting files, taking the step from detection to prevention using a similar technique. NoCry was developed from a prior tool in the same paper called UShallNotPass that leveraged the same prevention technique, but when developing NoCry the author made improvements to make the tool more secure, effective, and efficient. Testing NoCry against hundreds of ransomware samples yielded a 97% encryption prevention rate and UShallNotPass even protected the system from NotPetya, a feat no prior defense tool could accomplish [18]. By iteratively improving prevention techniques and coming up with creative approaches the problem of ransomware encryption prevention can effectively be solved.

Luckily for security researchers they’re not the only ones interested in defending against ransomware attacks, governments and law enforcement agencies are finally fighting too. For roughly the first decade of contemporary ransomware’s existence law enforcement has been disappointingly inactive, but it’s not entirely their fault. Most law enforcement agencies operate within a geographic region where they have jurisdiction, but since ransomware attacks happen online and often originate in a different geographic region than where users are victimized, attackers are beyond the reach of any single jurisdiction [7]. To make matters even more difficult cybercriminals use pseudo-anonymous payment methods and launder ransoms through multiple geographic and legal jurisdictions so tracking the money is difficult [7]. Thankfully, in 2018 a groundbreaking paper was published that deanonymized bitcoin laundering and presented a detailed examination of the ransomware ecosystem from victim bitcoin purchase all the way to attacker cash-out over a two year period [5]. Using a combination of real victims, intentional ransomware infections, ransomware source code, network traffic, and a large Bitcoin address database the research team learned that ransomware operators tend to cash out ransoms at a Russian bitcoin exchange called BTC-e [5]. In fact, 95% of all ransomware payments made between the start of 2014 and the middle of 2017 were converted to a fiat currency through BTC-e [38]. Armed with this knowledge the Northern District of California’s Department of Justice investigated and charged the operator of BTC-e, 37 year old Russian national Alexander Vinnik, with one count of operation of an unlicensed money service business, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, two counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions, and seventeen counts of money laundering [39]. In December of 2020 after multiple extraditions Vinnik was sentenced to five years in a French prison [40]. The paper that exposed Vinnik was the first of its kind, but after seeing the real world impact that a Bitcoin audit can have I expect to see more of this in the future.

Law enforcement efforts have gone beyond targeting individual cybercriminals in recent months, indicating a trend in the government's willingness to prevent ransomware. On April 15th, 2021 President Joe Biden signed an executive order placing economic sanctions on Russia in response to their involvement in the SolarWinds cyber attack [41]. The attack began in December of 2020 and took advantage of a weakness in the IT software SolarWinds to compromise 18,000 customers, nine federal agencies, and 100 private organizations [41]. While this executive order is just a first step it represents a positive trend for three main reasons. First, Biden’s administration has made it clear that further cyber attacks are unacceptable and it’s prepared to “impose substantial and lasting costs” if cyber attacks continue. Second, this executive order grants the US government additional powers it hasn’t had in the past. Third, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has stated its support for the executive order and “stands in solidarity with the United States” [41]. Considering all of these factors it’s evident that the US government, as well as governments abroad, are equipping themselves to combat ransomware that originates outside of their jurisdiction. By taking action now governments are preventing future ransomware attacks.

With the authority and resources of governmental bodies ransomware defense capabilities leap forward, but ll, there is still no substitution for effective user education as a prevention method. Along with endpoint security, cybersecurity experts cite user education as the most important method of fighting ransomware [6]. Awareness, behavior, and culture are considered the pillars of cybersecurity and experts can strengthen these pillars by disseminating their knowledge through training [23]. As discussed earlier, phishing emails are one of the most popular and effective attack vectors because they target the weak link in the security chain, the human user [42]. Information Security Awareness Training (ISAT) can help employees protect their organizations by not falling victim to social engineering attacks such as phishing emails. Implementing an effective ISAT program is not an easy task, but there are extensive resources for ISAT at organizations’ disposal; successful programs tend to conduct routine training year-round and identify the specific needs of the organization [42]. Once an organization tries a few approaches and figures out what works best for them the program can mature allowing the organization to benefit from an immense return on investment as their overall security improves. A review of security literature has shown significant organizational security improvements due to behavior changes from ISAT programs [42]. Moving forward, organizations are likely to invest in ISAT programs because it is financially sensible, and that increasing demand for effective ISAT will foster a strong security industry and mature the overall defense ecosystem.

Ransomware awareness can still be improved without the need for costly ISAT programs though. The cybersecurity community has agreed on best practices for organizations and individual users. Many of the organizational practices require information security administration and pertain to large interconnected systems, but individual best practices are attainable for most Internet users. From a review of the literature these are seven security practices that you can implement to prevent becoming a victim of a ransomware attack [7, 43, 44]:

- Regularly back up data offline and check on it. Backups may be the best recovery method 

- Since users are targeted focus on awareness of ransomware and training on information security principles and techniques 

- Update the operating system, software, and firmware, especially when vulnerabilities are discovered 

- Install anti-virus and anti-malware tools. Make sure they scan regularly and update automatically 

- Try not to open or reply to spam emails. Do not click on links or open attachments unless you can verify the sender 

- Exercise caution when using a public Wi-Fi network. Use network protection such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) 

- Disable network file sharing and deactivate unused wireless connection ports such as Bluetooth or infrared

### *D. Defense Conclusion*
Ransomware defense effectiveness is trending upwards across all three defense paradigms as increasing attention and resources are devoted to them. For roughly fifteen years security researchers had no choice but to react to attacks and analyze their methods. But within the last few years detailed, comprehensive models have finally become available allowing security experts to work proactively and improve reactive methods. Defenders wouldn’t have been able to understand their adversary without behavioral analysis laying the groundwork for developing attack models with far reaching benefits, such as the effectiveness of key escrow systems. Decoy file defenses are also getting better at detecting attacks with minimal damage, and research in this area has even outpaced real-world ransomware threats. Still, file backups are perhaps the most effective way to thwart ransomware, and attackers have few options for countering this simple defense method.

Proactive defense is where efforts are primarily focused now, and the methods emerging from this approach are the key to turning the tides in the ransomware battle. Binary analysis tools have the ability to prevent known ransomware threats with no risk to the user’s system, and new tools using novel methods can even outperform that. NoCry controls access to the system’s encryption functions to defeat unknown ransomware threats and the Moving Target Defense methods continuously changes file extensions to achieve the same outcome. New and innovative security tools such as these are published every year that build upon recent research, meaning that defense progress is accelerating. For example, PEDA combines two defense techniques to create a multilayered, self-updating security tool. What will next year’s cybersecurity journals bring?

Aside from technical solutions to prevent ransomware the cybersecurity community has learned how to map and expose the cybercriminal black market, allowing the US government to step in and perform its newfound anti-ransomware duties. Ever improving ISAT programs are enabling stronger protection for organizations and will continue to mature as more organizational customers adopt this preventative measure. In the neverending battle against ransomware best practices and defense tools are the shield, and law enforcement is the sword.
