## I. INTRODUCTION
Ransomware extortion is an emerging type of crime in which victims must pay to regain access to their computer or files. You may have heard of ransomware in the news before. Just last year it was responsible for a shutting-down hundreds of hospitals in one of the largest medical cyberattacks the United States has ever seen [1]. A 2014 ransomware attack has cost Home Depot more than US$200 million in total [2]. Maersk, world leader in container shipping, had to replace 50,000 computers in an attack that has cost the company roughly US$300 million [3]. Cumulatively, ransomware is estimated to cost the globe US$20 billion by 2021 [4]. Undeniably, ransomware has established itself in the few years it’s existed, but what does the future hold for ransomware?

For the last fifteen years cybersecurity experts have been fighting an ongoing battle to protect the world from ransomware. Cybercriminals and cybersecurity experts are constantly racing to outpace each other’s progress. As ransomware techniques evolve, new security tools evolve to thwart cybercriminals. In response, new ransomware techniques emerge to evade security measures. Eventually one side has to win out; either ransomware will become too difficult to be profitable, or security will be too difficult to be feasible.

The purpose of this literature review is to examine the techniques that have emerged in ransomware attack and defense to inform predictions about the prevalence and severity of this crime in coming years. Drawing methodological trends from the literature allows me to infer the trajectories of both cybercriminals and security researchers. I review scholarly sources, predominantly peer reviewed research articles, but also industry publications, news articles, and topical podcasts to establish the methods by which ransomware attacks are carried out, as well as cybersecurity experts' approaches to ransomware defense. By comparing the progress in these two fields I’ll argue that ransomware is a serious threat, but a threat that cybersecurity experts can mitigate and significantly diminish in the future.
