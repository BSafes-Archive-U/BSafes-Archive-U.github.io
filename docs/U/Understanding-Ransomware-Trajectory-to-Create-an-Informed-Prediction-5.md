## V. ATTACK OVERVIEW
Ransomware authors have to make many choices when they write their malware. Like most criminals, their primary incentive is to maximize their financial gain. Don’t forget, no matter how sophisticated the attack, money doesn’t come from the computer, it must come from the victim. The best way to maximize profits is by making the right decisions about what user market to target, what computer system to attack, and how to infect that computer. Like many industries cybercriminals are in competition with one another, and as such they observe each other succeeding or failing they learn from one another and an ecosystem forms that practices Darwinian evolution. Over time this has led to impressive technological innovation by cyber criminals. In this section I’ll investigate the decisions ransomware attackers must make, and identify overarching trends in the attacker ecosystem.

### *A. Users Targeted*
Ransomware authors must decide what type of users to attack, essentially who they’d like to extort. As mentioned before, ransomware attacks are fundamentally financially motivated, so choosing which users to target is at its core an economic decision. Originally, attackers did not write their ransomware with a particular type of user in mind, choosing instead to cast a wide net with their attacks [7]. This approach works because of the sheer quantity of Internet users; attackers are collecting relatively small ransoms from many victims. A single ransomware virus could be distributed to millions of users worldwide and only a small fraction of users would need to pay the ransom to make the whole scheme profitable. More recently however, ransomware attackers’ preferences seem to have shifted to favor collecting relatively large ransoms from fewer victims. Rather than targeting individuals ransomware authors are now focused more on targeting organizations [9, 18].

For the majority of ransomware’s history home users have been victimized by attacks more than organizations. According to Symantec’s 2015 whitepaper, ransomware is particularly effective against home users for three key reasons. First, because they’re an individual rather than an organization they have the least amount of access to technical assistance. Second, they are the least likely to be fluent with their technology. And third, they are the least likely to be familiar with ransomware. Considering those three key reasons, it’s easy to imagine how home user victims can feel helpless, scared, and overwhelmed when they discover they’ve been attacked. Ransomware attackers know that those emotions improve their odds of collecting a ransom, and as such, manipulate those emotions in a practice known as social engineering [7]. Home users have sentimental attachment to the data being held for ransom because personally important files, information, and documents are at stake. A low ransom may be a small price to pay to regain access to wedding photos, a video game save file, a nearly completed thesis paper, or your medical records. Stop and think, is there anything on your home system that you couldn’t live without?

Nowadays, ransomware attackers mostly target organizations, defined as private businesses and public agencies such as educational institutes, medical institutes, law enforcement entities, etc.. Unlike an individual home user, organizations have access to far greater resources. Those resources enable organizations to hire cyber security professionals that can help implement effective defenses against ransomware attacks and respond to an ongoing attack. Organizations can also purchase ransomware insurance to mitigate the financial risk of a ransomware attack. In fact, 84% of organizations surveyed in a 2020 study had cybersecurity insurance, and 80% of those policies cover ransomware [24]. However, data can still be stolen from the company records and extorted by threatening to release it to the public, which insurance doesn’t help with. It may seem like organizations are safe from attacks because of the resources at their disposal, however many businesses rely on their digital systems to perform their service, so a ransomware attack that interrupts their services can put them out of business [7, 25]. In this way a ransomware attack can be fatal for a company in a way it isn’t for an individual.

Since roughly 2015 there has been an apparent shift in ransomware attacker’s approach. Rather than targeting home users, ransomware authors have transitioned away from residential attacks and are focusing on business and agency attacks [18]. Interestingly, despite what news headlines would lead us to believe, the private sector is attacked more frequently than the public sector; generally, private organizations have no obligation to publicly report attacks and are actually incentivized not to report them. In 2019 alone 45% of public sector organizations reported being attacked by ransomware, less than the global average for any organization type at 51%, and less than the most frequently attacked industry (entertainment) at 60% [24]. Cybersecurity experts believe this trend exists because ransomware attacks are able to extort higher ransoms from a business than they could an individual [9]. According to a 2020 study analyzing business insurance claims, the cost of business interruptions in the form of lost revenue and repair costs often outweigh the ransom being demanded [25]. In our increasingly digitized economy a successful cyber attack can slow or halt all business operations, increasing the pressure felt by a ransomware victim to pay up.

This shift is good news for the average home Internet user but bad news for businesses and agencies. Continuing in this trajectory, in the future you’ll be less likely to have your wedding photos ransomed on your home computer, but more likely to have your workplace compromised. This trend emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity training in the workplace, now and in the future, since that’s where we see a disproportionately high amount of attacks.

### *B. Systems Targeted*
Ransomware authors must decide what type of computer to infect. Infection is their means of seizing something valuable from the victim, so they want to choose their target strategically. In general, cybercriminals are faced with four main systems: personal computers, mobile devices, servers, and Internet of Things devices [7]. The nature of most ransomware attacks requires that they can access cryptography tools already in the computer’s operating system (OS), so they need to be OS specific. Originally, ransomware was only designed to target personal computers, particularly Windows machines. But once mobile devices had been widely adopted by the public that opened the door for ransomware authors to expand their list of targeted systems. In recent years there’s been a dramatic shift towards mobile devices like cell phones and tablets, and Internet of Things devices such as security cameras and smart thermostats. Lastly, cloud computing has been consistently replacing on-premise servers and server attacks have followed suit, now targeting public cloud computing services.

Personal computers, particularly those running a Windows OS, have historically been the most heavily targeted system. The reason Windows was so heavily targeted is because Windows computers represent the vast majority of computers in use globally [7]. It made sense for criminals to target Windows at that time because most victims were accessible via Windows, and this was in a time when home users were still being targeted most heavily. When going after an organization attackers also tend to target servers, which often contain valuable data or host important web services. Attackers target servers because they’re usually business critical, and organizations risk serious losses if they can’t use their servers as detailed in the Users Targeted section. Ransomware attackers were targeting all technologies that were viable to attack in the early days of digitalization, victimizing people and organizations from all angles.

With the invention of smartphones came a new avenue of revenue for ransomware attackers. As smartphones and other mobile devices were widely adopted an increasing percentage of people owned personal computers, only these ones fit in your pocket. Mobile devices from smart watches to phones to tablets became the second most targeted system because of their ubiquity [7]. Ransomware authors pivoted to capitalize on the growing market and unsurprisingly this became a reliable method of targeting individual users.

Mobile devices tend to come in two OSs, either iOS or Android [7]. iOS for Apple devices are pretty safe because Apple has strict rules for app developers and consumers. Dissimilarly, Android is very open source and customizable, making them the primary target for mobile attacks. Also, Android has a larger share of the global market, roughly three quarters of phones use Android, so it makes sense from the perspective of attackers to go after the most victims possible [26]. Evidently, ransomware authors target their attacks wherever they see numerous ransoms to be paid, and therefore profit to be made.

It’s been more than a decade since the initial release of the smartphone, and in that time other technologies collectively referred to as Internet of Things (IoT) have emerged and risen to global popularity. IoT devices are electronics that use an Internet connection to transfer data and receive software updates. In 2018 these devices numbered between 18 billion and 35 billion, a significant growth from the estimated 2 billion devices in 2010 [27]. While smartphones are technically IoT devices, there’s been a trend towards expanding beyond mobile devices to other IoT devices. One particularly startling cyberattack of this nature, which was carried out by researchers rather than cybercriminals, targeted a Jeep Grand Cherokee. The researchers were able to remotely take control of the vehicle over the Internet, controlling the steering, brakes, radio, air conditioning, essentially everything, leaving the driver powerless [28]. If it’s possible for researchers it’s possible for cybercriminals, and it’s not hard to imagine how a cybercriminal could extort any ransom they please when they can steer you into oncoming traffic. A more recent but equally memorable example, this time perpetrated by genuine cybercriminals, involved extracting a casino’s customer database through an unsecured fish tank thermometer [29]. While no ransom was demanded, this attack clearly demonstrates cybercriminals’ ability to innovate and find security weaknesses in new technologies.

The trend of innovative extortion continues to this day, as evidenced by the growing presence of public cloud attacks. In the early years of ransomware servers physically existed at the same location as the organization’s buildings -- these are known as on-premise servers -- so ransomware attacks targeted on-premise servers. Now however, many organizations have pivoted away from on-premise servers and are opting instead to use a public cloud to store their data, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. According to a 2020 survey of 5,000 information technology (IT) managers across a variety of organizations 59% of cryptoransomware attacks included encrypting data in the public cloud [24]. If that weren’t enough, cloud security threats have heightened dramatically with the coronavirus pandemic pushing so many employees to work remotely, forcing the suspension of IT security standards at short notice [25]. A survey conducted after the onset of the pandemic of 250 Chief Information Security Officers at large companies listed cloud usage in the top three threats during the work from home period [25]. Cybercriminals are undeniably opportunistic, and will exploit changes in technology and technology usage to their advantage.

Systems targeted by ransomware started simple but have been expanding to keep up with technological innovation and user behavior, trending most recently towards Internet of Things devices and public cloud services. This demonstrates cybercriminals’ willingness to branch out and try new targets. As new technologies continually emerge and are widely adopted, new attack surfaces repeatedly present themselves and cybercriminals are always going to pursue those possibilities. It’s up to ransomware defenders to prevent those possibilities from coming to fruition and victimizing individuals and organizations.

### *C. Infection Method*
Once a ransomware author has created their virus it must be distributed to computer systems to create victims and generate revenue. Cybercriminals have many choices when deciding how to infect victims, but traditional choices have taken advantage of human error, or at least human interaction. Techniques are constantly evolving though, and recent developments have circumvented the need for human error. Ransomware infection vectors are trending towards more automated and efficient distribution.

Historically, ransomware authors have relied upon their victims taking action to infect systems. This variety of infection generally takes the form of a malicious email attachment, a malicious website that performs an unsolicited download, or malicious advertisements on an otherwise trustworthy website. Ransomware authors prefer these methods because in most cases it’s much easier to trick a user into downloading a file or visiting a website than it is to bypass the user and trick the computer.

The most popular infection method over the last fifteen years has been malicious emails disguised as harmless emails that aim to deceive the recipient into downloading an attachment or clicking a link [6]. Oftentimes the attachment will be the ransomware binary, so once it’s downloaded it begins executing and encrypting files. In the case of a malicious link the most likely scenario is that it leads to a malicious website that performs an unsolicited download (known as a “drive-by download”). You’ve probably been warned about these emails before, they’re commonly referred to as phishing emails. According to a 2020 survey of 5,000 IT managers across a variety of organizations 45% of ransomware attacks originated from phishing emails [24]. When cybercriminals send out millions of these emails it’s referred to as malspam. Malspam is effective because cybercriminals can get very creative with their emails, using a variety of psychological tactics to convince the recipient to click, such as time sensitive offers. Cybercriminals are targeting the weakest link in security systems -- humans -- when they’re engaging in phishing malspam, so the only effective mitigation is user education.

Besides fooling the user with phishing email, cybercriminals have used two main methods to download their binaries onto victims’ systems. First, cybercriminals create malicious websites for the sole purpose of performing drive-by downloads. All the user has to do is visit the site for their device to become infected, so attackers redirect traffic to their site. Cybercriminals use exploit kits, ransomware tools packaged together for ease, to redirect users from a legitimate website to a malicious website [9]. In this scenario a user could click a link from a search results page or a phishing email and, through no fault of their own, end up on a malicious website. This technique requires human action, but not human error, and as such are difficult to mitigate with user education alone. Second, cybercriminals can compromise a trustworthy website by inserting malicious code into advertisements they take out [9]. These advertisements may redirect users that click on the ad to a malicious website, or they may perform a drive-by download without the need for users to even click the ad. This technique is especially effective because cybercriminals can compromise websites with heavy traffic, such as Spotify or The New York Times [30].

Recently however, ransomware authors have been coming up with techniques that eliminate the need for victim action. Older techniques still get plenty of use because they’re undeniably effective, but ransomware innovation is headed in the direction of automation. Newer ransomware samples such as WannaCry can automatically self-replicate over the internet network by taking advantage of a Windows OS security flaw, therefore any device connected to the same internet as the infected device is immediately at risk. Admittedly, this technique still relies on user action to initiate, but once that has happened further propagation is user-free. This represents an all new threat level because once one device becomes infected then any data on the network is in peril, gone are the days of one action leading to one infection.

Another growing trend in the ransomware distribution space is the adoption of the Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) affiliate profit sharing scheme. RaaS is a criminal business model where one party creates the ransomware and hires other parties to distribute the ransomware [9]. This model has two main benefits. First, the risk of being caught is shared between the two parties [7]. Ransomware authors insulate themselves from the risks of distribution by interfacing with victims through their affiliates [31]. Affiliates are presumably willing to assume this risk because they get a share of the ransom without writing any ransomware. Second, division of labor allows cybercriminals to specialize and focus on what they do best, whether that be programming or distribution [7]. Many ametuer cybercriminals lack the skills and resources necessary to write code that can outsmart modern cybersecurity defenses, but they are capable of malspam and drive-by downloads [7]. Exploit kits can be purchased for a nominal fee, or even found for free, on the Dark Web and that’s all someone needs to begin participating in the cybercriminal ecosystem [9]. RaaS lowers the barrier of entry for cybercriminals, expanding the reach that authors can have [7]. Ransomware is trending towards organized crime, ransomware defenders and law enforcement must incorporate this knowledge into their respective approaches.

### *D. Attack Conclusion*
Ransomware attacks are a growing threat, there's no denying that attackers are continuing to innovate. Attackers have set their sights on organizational cash cows while at the same time finding new ways to victimize individuals. Tried and true methods of infection such as phishing malspam and website redirects are being made easier by the availability of exploit kits and RaaS partnerships. Alongside those methods, newer more efficient ransomware variants that spread like a virus without user interaction are being added to attackers’ arsenal. As it stands now, there’s a strong financial incentive for attackers to develop new techniques to maximize their revenue from exploiting users, and that’s led to serious innovation.

Modern ransomware has been in its heyday since its birth in 2006. It came into a world that was totally unprepared to defend against it and in many ways it still enjoys the element of surprise. Cybercriminals inherently have a head start because when they develop new and creative attack methods it takes time for cybersecurity defenders to engineer and implement defenses. To make matters worse, the attack surface for ransomware authors is rapidly expanding as the world becomes more digitized and interconnected, particularly threatening IoT devices. Meanwhile, cybercriminals are utilizing business models to specialize their labor, allowing for faster development by increasingly powerful authors, and more menacing distribution from a wave of ametuer cybercriminals. For these reasons ransomware isn’t going away immediately.
