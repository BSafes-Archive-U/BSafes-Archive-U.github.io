## Section 1: the emergence and development of the US existence in Iraq
After the United States of America launched the war on Iraq in March 2003 and was able to occupy it on April 9, 2003, then US President George W. Bush announced the end of the so-called "Iraq liberation war", and then on May 22, 2003 Security Council Resolution 1483 was issued at the request of An American ruled at the time that the American and allied forces in the war were the occupying forces of Iraq. (El-Hajj, 2010)

The American military existence in it took the direct form and the static military positioning. The American forces were distributed in all parts and regions of Iraq and their numbers increased until they reached about 170 thousand soldiers in the year 2007 in light of the deterioration of the security situation, the occurrence of sectarian violence and terrorist operations. 570 large, medium and small fortified bases, and these bases were often camps for the former Iraqi army and fortified presidential palaces, and were equipped with warfare and logistical services suitable for the American forces in light of the deterioration of security and the attacks they faced by many armed groups that appeared at that stage. (Saqr Center for Strategic Studies, 2010)

In November 2008, the United States of America signed the Iraq security agreement to regulate the military withdrawal from Iraq, whose first article stipulated the "scope and purpose" that: "This agreement sets out the main provisions and requirements that regulate the temporary existence of US forces in Iraq, their activities there, and their withdrawal from Iraq." (America, 2008) This agreement paved the way for setting a schedule for the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq at the end of 2011, the year in which there were approximately 39,000 American soldiers dispersed over 18 military bases in a number of Iraqi provinces. (Saeed, 2020)

Just as the two countries signed in 2008 the strategic framework agreement for friendship and cooperation relations between them, which talked about a strategic partnership between the two countries and defined the form of trade, investment, diplomatic, cultural and security and military cooperation between the United States of America and Iraq. (America, 2008) Although the situation in Iraq at that stage largely indicates the need for Iraq to assist the American forces and the necessity for their direct continuation in the Iraqi arena and perhaps for many years in order to ensure the preservation of security and stability in Iraq, the facts of the American and Iraqi arenas at the political level have led to the trend towards The completion of the American military withdrawal from Iraq, which was described by then US President Barack Obama in his speech at the White House, saying: "Now is the time to turn the page" and he meant the Iraq page. (Madi, 2010)

But it wasn't long before the American forces withdrew from Iraq until the Iraqi government submitted an official request to the United States of America to help its forces in the war against terrorist groups after ISIS managed to seize large areas of the country in June 2014, and indeed the American forces began to return to Iraq, and this return came based on what was approved by the strategic framework agreement between the two countries in the third section, "Defense and Security Cooperation" from it, and the agreement between them regarding the withdrawal of the United States forces from Iraq, from which the fourth article indicated in its first paragraph that "the Iraqi government requests temporary assistance from the forces The United States to support it in its efforts to maintain security and stability in Iraq, including cooperation in conducting operations against al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups and outlaw groups and the remnants of the previous regime. Iraq to fight ISIS. (Diab, 2010) , Distributed between the coach and a specialist technician and adviser to military and security forces and special assignments in many locations and military bases in Iraq. (Attaya, 2018)

Despite the announcement of the defeat Daesh militarily in Iraq by the end of 2017, but the US military existence in Iraq remained in place in the continuation of many of his duties, and added to the US troops pulled out of Syria, amounting to nearly 2130 military in 2019 . (others, 2019)

It should be mentioned that the American military existence on his return to Iraq was at the request of the government of Noori al-Maliki in 2014 in order to help in the fight against ISIS, and the establishment of fixed bases in Iraq was with the approval of the government of Haidar al-Abadi, who took over from the end of 2014 to 2018, including US military bases In the Kurdistan region, the resigned government of Adel Abdul Mahdi came in the existence of US forces in Iraq. (Hassoun, 2019)
