## VII. CONCLUSION
Ransomware will probably never disappear entirely, but with dedicated defense efforts it can be mitigated until it hardly remains. Over time attackers have shifted which users they target, which systems they target, and how they infect victims. New and creative attack methods will always be emerging, but defenders are getting better at understanding and mitigating their threat. Every approach to ransomware defense, recovery, detection, and especially prevention, has seen promising development in recent years. Defenders will continue to refine attack models and implement tools based on that understanding, until eventually attacking is no longer worth the risk or cost, and then ransomware’s threat will be diminished.

Realistically, the threat of ransomware may need to get worse before it can get better. Whenever attackers successfully collect a ransom payment they’re also sowing the seeds of their own demise because they’re incentivizing stronger defenses. Even money lost from damage to infected computer systems, that ransomware attackers never receive, is mounting motivation for Internet users to invest the resources necessary in ransomware defense. Every dollar of damage that ransomware attackers inflict increases the target on their back.

In response to the demand for ransomware defense academic researchers and private cybersecurity firms, alongside massive law enforcement resources, have begun to turn the tide. Preventative methods will enable defenders to overtake attack progress in the future. Surely there will be seen and unforeseen challenges, but as time goes on the collaborative nature of defense research will overpower the competitive nature of attack. Ultimately attack innovations are motivated by profit, therefore ransomware developers are always in anonymous competition with one another. Even collaborative cybercriminal schemes like Ransomware as a Service will soon be dismantled by defender’s new ability to track payments. Conversely, defenders accumulate their knowledge and share it because they’re united by a common enemy. That’s why defense will continue to accelerate until ransomware attacking isn’t worth the risk or cost anymore. It’s a war of attrition and at that point cybercriminals will move on to the next best profitable crime fad, and then ransomware’s threat will be diminished. I don’t expect it to disappear entirely, but it will be relegated to niche attacks, only a shell of what the ransomware crime wave once was.
