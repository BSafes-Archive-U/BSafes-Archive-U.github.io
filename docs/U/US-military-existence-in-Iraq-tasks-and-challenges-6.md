## Conclusion
We see that the issue of the direct US military existence in Iraq has passed through two stages: The first began when the US forces occupied Iraq and toppled the existing regime on April 9, 2003, and continued until the end of 2011 when the last remaining forces withdrew based on the agreement to withdraw US forces from Iraq. As for the second stage, it began with ISIS seizing large areas of Iraq since June 10, 2014, and the Iraqi government requested the assistance of the American forces in the war on terror.

However, the tasks and objectives of the US military existence have evolved over time, especially under the Donald Trump administration, whose administration has worked to develop some US bases in Iraq, especially Ein AlAsaad, and has become one of the tasks and objectives of the US forces to monitor Iran's activities in Iraq and work to counter Iranian influence in The Iraqi arena, so that Iraq has become an arena for settling scores between the United States of America and Iran, and it is not ruled out that Iraq is a starting point for any war between the two parties.
