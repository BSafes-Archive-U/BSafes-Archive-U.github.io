## POLICYMAKING & LEGISLATION

### AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT AND POLICY STRUCTURE
Australia and New Zealand are both heavily dependent on undersea cable communication for their economic growth and national security, which carry the preponderance of bulk voice and data traffic in and out of these countries. A 2013 Australian Parliamentary Library study determined nearly $A 220 billion ($224.642 billion) in non-cash payments are made each business day using undersea cables representing 20% of Gross Domestic Product. Such factors have made them global leaders in developing legal architecture to protect their continuing access to these critical geopolitical infrastructures. In 2005, the Australian Government establishing a regime for protecting these cables landing in Australia by giving the Australian Communications Authority (now the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)) power to declare protection zones relating to undersea cables where certain activities may be prohibited, restrictions may be imposed on other activities, and carriers wishing to install undersea cables in Australian waters must apply and receive permission from ACMA.<sup>20</sup>

A 2013 Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) study on this subject warned that the majority of these cables are located near protection zones in Perth and Sydney. This makes them vulnerable to accidental or intentional breakage, warned that the Australian Federal Police who is responsible for ensuring compliance with national laws takes a reactive instead of proactive enforcement approach, and that cable company owners and operators say the Australian Safety Authority and Fisheries Management Authority are not doing a good job of monitoring cable protection zones. A Royal Australian Navy Sea Power Center assessment noted cables are vulnerable to accidental damage from earthquakes, fishing trawlers, anchors, dumping, sand dredging, turbidity currents, and espionage by state actors and terrorists. <sup>21</sup>

During 2017/18 ACMA granted permission for installation of an undersea cable connecting Sydney and the United States, which was completed on June 30, 2018; granted two protection zone installation permits to conduct Perth and Singapore; and approved three separate requests extending the duration of existing protection zone permits. <sup>22</sup> Under current Australian law, the maximum penalties for intentionally interrupting or obstructing submarine communications is 12 months imprisonment and a fine of $A 4,200 ($3,226). The maximum penalty for an individual engaging in conduct and being negligent and injuring an undersea vessel as a result of an Australian-flagged vessel breaking or injuring a submarine cable is 3 months imprisonment and a $A 2,100 ($1,613) fine. An emerging undersea cable geopolitical matter Canberra will also have to confront is if neighboring countries such as Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands decide to adopt Chinese Internet infrastructure unless Australia increases its development to these countries to expand and maintain their undersea cables. <sup>23</sup>

Enforcing violations of undersea cable infrastructure is a problem in national and international law. A 2007 Tulane Maritime Law Journal analysis was skeptical that national governments possessed the legal authority to arrest saboteurs under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and 2005 Suppression of Unlawful Acts Convention Amendments. This work went on to maintain that the possibility of terrorist attacks against undersea cables and pipelines was not considered by international legal authorities or giving nation states the international legal authority to protect pipelines and undersea cables. <sup>24</sup>

During 2018, the Australian Government enacted the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act, which aspired to create a legal framework for managing critical infrastructure such as undersea cables. This statute gave the Minister of Home Affairs responsibility for compiling a register of critical infrastructure assets but prohibiting the public disclosure of this register with a criminal penalty two years imprisonment and/ or fine of $A 26,640 ($20,463). <sup>25</sup>

The legal foundation for New Zealand’s undersea cable protection begins with the 1996 Submarine Cables and Pipeline Protection Act. This established a maximum criminal penalty of NZ $250,000 ($178,487) for anyone convicted of willfully or negligently damaging or permitting a ship or equipment to damage a submarine cable or pipeline and owns or operates the ship involved in causing such damage. This statute establishes fourteen Cable Protection Zones (CPZ) where anchoring and most types of fishing are banned to prevent cable damage. These CPZ’s are enforced by New Zealand’s Ministry of Transport and consist of the following areas with fishing and anchoring in these areas producing the following fines $NZ 2000 ($1,427) plus court and legal costs for recreational boat users offenses, $NZ 100,000 ($71,334) for fishing and anchoring where commercial gain is involved, and $NZ 20,000 ($14,279) in other cases. <sup>26</sup>

### U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY STRUCTURE
The U.S.’ civilian and military undersea cable policymaking structure is byzantine and labyrinthine with many agencies having jurisdictional engagement in this arena. U.S. laws are codified into the United States Code (USC), which is broken down into 54 title or subject areas. A quick online search of the USC using the U.S. House of Representatives Office of Law Revision Counsel website https://uscode. house.gov/ retrieves relevant citations from 10 of these 54 titles.

▶ 3 USC 301 gives the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authority to approve or revoke licenses to land or operate submarine cables in the U.S. without presidential approval. <sup>27</sup> 

▶ 10 USC 113 gives the Secretary of Defense statutory authority to build such cables and pipelines. <sup>28</sup>

▶ 26 USC 168 can allow for undersea cables to be taxexempt if part of an exclusive communication link between the U.S. and one or more foreign countries. <sup>29</sup>

▶ 33 USC 3 allow the Army Corps of Engineers to prepare regulations on areas of navigable waters featuring such cables to regulate explosives transportation in these waters.<sup>30</sup>

▶ 33 USC 3204 allow the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) to integrate tsunami warning systems into federal undersea cables.<sup>31</sup>

This statutory cornucopia continues with 42 USC 9113, which imposes criminal penalties of up to two years, fines of up to $5,000, or both for negligently breaking of injuring undersea cables.<sup>32</sup>

▶ 42 USC 9164 requires the Energy Department and other interested federal agencies and departments to establish and enforce regulations and standards of the safe construction and operation of undersea cables and equipment subject to U.S. jurisdiction.<sup>33</sup>

▶ 43 USC 1331 gives international ships and aircraft navigation and overflight freedoms and the ability to lay undersea cables and pipelines under UNCLOS within the U.S.’ contiguous zone.<sup>34</sup>

▶ 47 USC 26 gives military ship commanders to require foreign ship commanders to provide documentation from ships trespassing in areas where U.S. undersea cables are,<sup>35</sup> and 

▶ 47 USC 34 prohibits individuals landing or operating in the U.S. from using an undersea cable to directly or indirectly connect U.S. territory with any foreign country without a written license from the President.<sup>36</sup>

The Commerce Department’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) regulates whether and how proposed submarine cables may be installed in National Marine Sanctuaries according to international agreements the U.S. is part of and according to international law. NOAA is authorized to assess fair market value fees along with administrative and monitoring costs involved with the ongoing presence of commercial cables in National Marine Sanctuaries. Additional NOAA cable responsibilities include administering the Coastal Zone Management Act, which seeks to manage coastal resources balancing economic development and environmental conservation. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is a trustee for coastal and marine resources including commercial and recreational fisheries, marine mammals, and endangered and threatened species and their habitats, which may be impacted by cable laying operations. NOAA permits are required when underwater cable laying may impact marine mammals, which can include underwater noise and surface and underwater vessel activity. <sup>37</sup>

Several Defense Department (DOD) entities are involved in undersea cable policymaking activities. These include the Naval Seafloor Cable Protection Office (NSCPO). Established in 2000, by Naval Facilities Engineering Command, NSCPO is the contact point between DOD and Navy seafloor cables. Such cables are used for fleet underwater test and training ranges, sensor systems, communications and data links, and observation and monitoring systems. <sup>38</sup>

The USNS Zeus is the U.S.’ only cable laying/repair ship and is responsible for transporting, deploying, repairing, and retrieving undersea cables. It has been in service since 1984 and its contractors were General Dynamics and National Steel & Shipbuilding Corporation. Its length is 513 feet, beam is 73 feet, it displaces 15,174 tons, maximum speed is 14 knots, and its crew size is 58. <sup>39</sup>

The Army Corps of Engineers is authorized to regulate artificial islands, installations, and devices (including cables) on the U.S. outer continental shelf seabed with this authority being focused on how cables can potentially impact navigation and national security along with carrying out National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses unless another agency has primary authority over the cable permitting process. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is responsible for securing and enhancing DOD telecommunications networks including the undersea communication constellation. This agency also sponsors research in these areas and awards grants to contractors. <sup>40</sup>

The Energy Department’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) possesses some authority over proposed undersea cables to be laid on the U.S. continental shelf. Examples of such projects include constructing and operating hydrokinetic projects on the Outer Continental Shelf such as wave power generation facilities. Cable laying related to such projects would involve assessing cable environmental impacts along with collaborating with the Army Corps of Engineers on possible national security and navigational impacts. <sup>41</sup>

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for submarine cables landing in the U.S. The 1921 Cable Licensing Act gives the FCC licensing authority covering “any submarine cable directly or indirectly connecting the United States with one foreign country, or connecting one portion of the United States with any other portion thereof.” FCC authorities also include regulating the landing and operating of communication cables laid in U.S. coastal waters with Executive Order 10,530 (May 10, 1954) giving the FCC power to exercise presidential authority to issue, revoke, or withhold licenses to land and operate submarine cables in the U.S. after receiving the Secretary of State’s approval. <sup>42</sup>

This agency’s International Bureau, Telecommunications, and Analysis Division is responsible for issuing licenses to own and operate undersea cables and landing stations in the U.S. and is also responsible for authorizing modifications, transfers, or assignments of existing cable landing licenses. On August 29, 2017 this division of the FCC issued its 2015 International Circuit Capacity Report, which revealed that the total available capacity of U.S. international cables increased from 91,000 gigabit per second circuits (GPBS) in 2014 to nearly 120,000 GPBS in 2015. It also documented a 35% growth in submarine cable capacity between 2007-2015; with the Atlantic Region accounting for 40% of total available capacity, the Pacific Region for 37%, and the America’s Region for 23%. This document also noted that the top foreign landing points for U.S. submarine cables were Colombia 9, Japan and the United Kingdom 7, Panama 6, Brazil and Venezuela 5, and Australia and Mexico. <sup>43</sup>

Various Department of the Interior agencies may become involved in undersea cable policymaking. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) derives authority from the 2005 Energy Policy Act to regulate cables supporting energy production, transmission, and transportation from energy sources besides oil and gas from the Outer Continental Shelf and cables laid to construct and maintain oil and gas platforms. <sup>44</sup> Cables operators seeking to build cables through terrestrial or marine areas administered by the National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service go through those agencies approval processes. In addition, the Antiquities Act of 1906 gives the President the authority to protect natural and cultural objects and potentially restrict cable laying through designating properties as national monuments. A relatively recent example of this was President George W. Bush using Antiquities Act authorities to designate the Papahanaumokukea Marine National Monument in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands on June 15, 2006. <sup>45</sup>

### RECENT U.S. LEGISLATION INCLUDING SUBMARINE CABLE REGISTRY
Undersea cables have received some attention in recent congressional legislation and debate, but they are primarily a niche subject for maritime security cognoscenti instead of being a focal point of international security and international economic analysis and debate. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-VA), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, has written that despite rhetoric about wireless and cloud computing the Internet does not involve invisible waves jumping from earth to space satellites and returning but by cables deep under the ocean’s surface. Since these cables are privately owned and maintained anyone with hostile intent and the ability to execute such intent can drastically impact our lives by attacking and destroying these cables. Using historical analogies, Wittman mentioned British destruction of most German undersea cables during World War I and the Soviet Union cutting cables off eastern Canada in 1959. He then noted that while cable laying and repair is easy for wear and tear and incidental damage there is not a clear and robust response plan for responding to intentional attacks on undersea cables.<sup>46</sup>

The Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) t of December 20, 2019 saw Congress create a Cable Security Fleet within the Transportation Department’s Maritime Administration (MARAD) to consist of two ships subsidized at $5 million per year through Fiscal Year 2035. Further conditions of this legislation including giving these vessels operating in areas designated by the Coast Guard as possessing a high risk of piracy to engage in non-lethal defense measures to protect the vessel and crew from unauthorized seizure at sea and that the Defense Department and Coast Guard will determine what non-lethal defense measures these ships and their crew can take. <sup>47</sup>

Despite the enhancement produced by the Cable Security Fleet’s creation, the convoluted complexity of U.S. Government Internet security programs was reflected in a September 10, 2019 joint congressional hearing by subcommittees of the House Armed Services and Oversight and Reform Committees on national Internet architecture security. During the hearing, Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL) asked Department of Homeland Security Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Jeannette Manfra who was responsible for defending undersea cables directly affecting the United States and its abilities to communicate in our economy and international waters. Manfra’s response reflects the byzantine complexity, interconnectivity, and dysfunctionality inherent in undersea cable policymaking:

*“The majority of submarine cables are privately owned by a mix of domestic and foreign entities. The protection of these cables is a complex question, considering they travel through domestic and international waters, some of which are contested areas. While the U.S. and its allies have significant interest in ensuring the safety and continued functionality of submarine cables, it will require a ‘‘concerted effort’’ from the United States and its allies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data that traverses subsea systems, in addition to the physical security of the cable and cable landing station. While DHS is the communications sector-specific agency per PPD–21, the current responsibility for defending undersea cables landing in the United States involves a ‘‘whole of government’’ approach, which includes the Navy in our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the Coast Guard within our 12 mile nautical sovereignty zone. Team Telecom— primarily made up of executive branch agencies DOD, DHS, and DOJ—acts as an advisory committee to the FCC in matters related to foreign investment into US domestic communications infrastructure. Letters of Assurance (LOAs) and Network Security Agreements (NSAs) are memorandums of understanding between the USG and the cable owners/ operators that govern the location of assets, types of principal equipment, physical access controls, and other relevant factors surrounding the functionality and protection of undersea cable systems. DOD, DHS, and DOJ enforce Team Telecom agreements through periodic compliance and mitigation visits to cable landing sites, network operations centers, and other relevant infrastructure. The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation investigate and prosecute criminal acts and espionage-related activities. These activities are informed by reporting from the intelligence community and various other federal agencies.” <sup>48</sup>*

The House Armed Services Committee version of the FY 2022 NDAA passed on September 10, 2021 recognized the increasing importance of undersea warfare by directing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to provide this committee a briefing on unmanned undersea and surface vehicles by March 1, 2022. Contents of this report were to include the extent to which the Navy has successfully identified all critical technologies necessary for unmanned maritime systems; how the Navy tracks technological development for unmanned maritime systems; and whether unmanned maritime technology systems meet Navy requirement and mission needs. It is uncertain whether this language will be included in the final FY 2022 NDAA. <sup>49</sup>

### INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS
Various international associations and government organizations also influence undersea cable policymaking. The International Cable Protection Committee, (ICPC) is an intergovernmental and commercial company organization, founded in 1958, whose membership consists of submarine telecommunications and power cable operators and cable ship owners and operators, which strives to help members improve undersea cable security by exchanging relevant environmental, legal, and technical information. ICPC includes more than 170 members from 65 countries. <sup>50</sup>

The United Nations Commission on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), ratified in 1982 by many countries, but not the U.S., whose objections include surrendering U.S. sovereignty and freedom of action, being subject to international lawsuits that would be economically injurious and harm U.S. environmental and military interests, and have to transfer seabed mineral resource royalties to the International Seabed Authority and though it to corrupt and unaccountable nations. <sup>51</sup>

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) established in 1948 as Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, the IMO Convention entered into force in 1958, and IMO received its present name in 1982. IMO describes its purpose as “to provide machinery for cooperation among Governments in the field of governmental regulation and practices relating to technical matters of all kinds affecting shipping engaged in international trade; to encourage and facilitate the general adoption of the highest practicable standards in matters concerning maritime safety, efficiency of navigation and prevention and control of marine pollution from ships.” <sup>52</sup>
