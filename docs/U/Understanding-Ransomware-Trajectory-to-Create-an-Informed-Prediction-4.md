## IV. RESEARCH JUSTIFICATION
Ransomware is a growing threat to which we are all vulnerable. Despite this fact, the general population isn’t adequately knowledgeable about ransomware or how to defend themselves against it, particularly college students [6]. A 2017 study found that despite being a likely target for ransomware attacks, more than half of college students were not familiar with the term ‘ransomware’ [6]. Cybersecurity experts refer to the three pillars of user-based cybersecurity: awareness, behavior, and culture [23]. In keeping with Portland State University’s motto “Let Knowledge Serve The City”, I wanted to take the opportunity to spread awareness about this danger to students and faculty and potentially have a positive impact on the cybersecurity of PSU. To this end I have included a list of seven best practices that Internet users can follow to protect themselves from becoming a ransomware victim in the Prevention section.
