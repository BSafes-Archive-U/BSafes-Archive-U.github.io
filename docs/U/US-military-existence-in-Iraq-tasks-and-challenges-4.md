## Section 3 : Tasks and Goals :
The American military existence in Iraq occupies a great strategic importance to the United States of America that comes from the strategic importance of Iraq on the one hand and the importance of the Middle East region in the American global strategy on the other hand, this importance necessitates that the United States of America have a direct military existence in Iraq and the region, on which it falls. Many of the tasks and goals required by the process of protecting and promoting US interests in Iraq and the Middle East, which can be summarized as follows:

1.The task of combating terrorism and in particular confronting ISIS is the first task and the main justification for the US military existence in Iraq and it was at the request of the Iraqi government to help curb ISIS, which seized several provinces, including Nineveh, Salah al-Din, Anbar and parts of Diyala, Kirkuk and Baghdad in June The US forces returned to Iraq as part of the "international coalition to combat terrorism" forces along with many other countries that reached 66 countries in 2016. The United States led this coalition and the US State Department implemented its comprehensive strategy aimed at weakening and destroying the organization once and for all. The campaign was called Which was led by the US forces with: “Operation Inherent Resolve”, and the operation is led by an American officer with the rank of Lieutenant General and carried out by a unified joint task force (CJTF-OIR) under the supervision of the US Central Command, and the mission of these forces is to strike ISIS strongholds and targets in Iraqi and Syrian territories And support the Iraqi forces in their battles against ISIS to regain control of the lands and areas it seized. (Konopal, 2017)

Although ISIS was declared militarily defeated and its last strongholds were liberated in Iraq, the organization still possesses some pockets and has carried out numerous terrorist operations, which means that the need for the existence of American forces to confront this organization and destroy its hideouts continues, and American forces are also working to support Iraqi forces in securing the borders And the implementation of joint operations and participation in intelligence operations and information that contribute to the fight against terrorism and the prosecution of ISIS elements or work to prevent the organization from re-emerging again, in order to eliminate it. (Knights, The Future of the Iraqi Armed Forces, 2016) Especially since there is information indicating that ISIS is planning to carry out dozens of terrorist operations in Iraq, and the United Nations has estimated that the organization still possesses reserves of up to 300 million dollars to support its terrorist operations, and from here the American forces will continue their mission and the ministers who participated in the coalition meeting pledged The international community to fight ISIS on November 14, 2019 continues to support Iraq in order to eliminate the organization, and in order to fulfill this pledge, the Americans believe that they must remain in Iraq, otherwise they will risk repeating the mistakes of 2011 when the early withdrawal of their forces led to the rise of ISIS in the first place in the first place. (Pollock, 2020)

2.Training and arming, the US forces in Iraq undertake several tasks in the field of supporting the security forces and the Iraqi army, including arming that includes aircraft and main weapons systems, equipment and maintenance work, providing intelligence information, and providing various other support such as training, exchanging experiences and providing advice in order to be Better Iraqi military operations. (Pfaff, 2020) 

3.Supporting stability in Iraq, US officials and the staff of the US administration see the necessity of continuing the US military existence in Iraq in order to support and achieve stability in the various regions of Iraq, especially the areas that were controlled by ISIS (Sabri, 2019), as it has a specific specificity and must be dealt with Especially in order to remove the reasons that were behind the control of ISIS.

4. Protecting American interests, the United States of America aims, through its direct military existence in the Iraqi arena, for this existence to be an appropriate tool to protect American interests in Iraq, which is represented in protecting the US embassy, which is the largest embassy of a foreign country in the region, not just Iraq, and protecting economic interests in Iraq. And ensuring existence on permanent bases in a country that occupies an important strategic position in the Middle East region, which is Iraq. (Azzam, 2020)

5.Confronting Iranian influence in Iraq, although one of the tasks and objectives of the US military existence in Iraq is evident by monitoring Iran and trying to balance its influence in the Iraqi arena, but a shift witnessed by these goals is the use of force directly against Iranian targets in Iraq or against whom The United States considers them allies or proxies of Iran in Iraq, and they pose a threat to its interests and to the Americans present in Iraq, both military and civilian, and it is very clear the direct use of military force against Iran in Iraq The assassination of General Qassim Soleimani, commander of the “Quds Force” in (IRG) The Iranian Revolutionary Guard, upon his arrival at Baghdad International Airport in early January 2020. From the armed factions and groups in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen on the other side. The American forces and its air force in Iraq launched numerous air strikes on camps for the Iraqi "Hezbollah Brigades" and weapons storage places belonging to it, including targeting five facilities in Iraq and Syria on December 29, 2019, killing 15 of its members, including two of its leaders, which the Pentagon considered "defensive strikes." A minute "aims to" hinder the party's ability to launch future attacks against forces of " Operation Inherent Resolve " (DW website, 2019). In March 2020, the US forces in Iraq launched strikes against Hezbollah Brigades sites in Iraq in response to a missile attack targeting the Taji camp, killing two American and British soldiers and wounding others. The Pentagon confirmed that the strikes affected facilities that include weapons stores that are used to target The US and coalition forces, and that these strikes "are the appropriate and direct response to the threat posed by the Iranian-backed militias," and the targeted sites were in Najaf and others in southern Baghdad. (BBC News Arabic, 2020) 

And that the goals and tasks for which the US forces came were characterized by change and expansion, and were not limited to the task of confronting terrorism and fighting ISIS only or supporting the Iraqi forces, but rather it adopted another goals, perhaps the most important of which is confronting Iranian influence in Iraq, especially in light of the direction of the Donald Trump administration.
