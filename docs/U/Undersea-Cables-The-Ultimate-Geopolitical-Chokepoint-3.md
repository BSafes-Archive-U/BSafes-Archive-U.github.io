## INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION & DAMAGE
Any country, individual, or transnational terrorist group could seek to damage or destroy undersea cables.

### RUSSIA AND CHINA
Two countries of particular concern to undersea cable infrastructure to the U.S. and its allies include Russia and China. An early example of U.S. concern over Soviet/Russian attempts to destroy undersea cables occurred between February 21-25, 1959 when the Soviet trawler Novorossiisk disrupted communications between various U.S., Canadian, and European locales by damaging five transatlantic cables near Newfoundland in a rectangle bounded by the following coordinates: Latitude 49°24 N; Longitude 50°12 W; Latitude 49°32 N; Longitude 49°48 W; Latitude 50°13 N; Longitude 51°00 W; and Latitude 50°22 N; Longitude °50.36 W. In response, at 11:55 AM Eastern Standard Time on February 26, 1959, the commander of the USS Roy O. Hale, using his authority under the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Undersea Submarine Cables, sent an unarmed party of one officer and four enlisted men to board the Novorossiisk and examining the ship’s papers with its commanders consent. The U.S. announced it reserved the right to make claims for damages against Moscow and the Soviet Union protested against this activity. <sup>53</sup>

U.S. concern over Russian undersea cables continued in the 1970s, when the specially adapted nuclear submarine USN Halibut spent several months tapping Soviet communication cables in the Sea of Okhotsk north of Japan as part of Operation Ivy Bells. <sup>54</sup> The current edition of The Military Balance notes “the recent focus on the potential vulnerability of the undersea cable network raises issues of how to monitor, identify, and…defend against attacks on these vital information arteries…this and the recent events in the Gulf point to an increased need for persistent surveillance so that hostile activities can be identified, attributed, and tackled.” <sup>55</sup>

An October 25, 2015 New York Times article referencing U.S. intelligence and military personnel maintaining that Russia’s increasing geopolitical assertiveness could lead it to sever fiber optical cables at hard-to-access locations to halt the instantaneous communications abilities these cables provide with devastating consequences. Earlier in 2015 the Russian spy ship Yantar, carrying two self-propelled deep-sea submersible craft, slowly cruised the U.S. east coast to Cuba the site of a major U.S. cable landing point at Guantánamo Bay. During this journey, Yantar was constantly monitored by U.S. satellites, ships, and planes with naval officials saying the ship and its submersibles were capable of cutting cables miles below the ocean’s surface. Such operations are consistent with increasing Russian assertiveness in locales as varied as Crimea, Syria, and eastern Ukraine and reflect Moscow’s emphasis on hybrid warfare to cripple NATO decisionmaking. <sup>56</sup>

Speaking before the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) on December 14, 2017, British Chief of Defense Staff Air Chief Marshall Stuart Peach, maintained that the threat from Russia’s Navy with modernized conventional submarines and ships represents “a new risk to our way of life.” A story on this event also noted that retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis said Internet cables could be a tempting target for the Russians, other powers, and that U.S. and its NATO allies should prepare for increased maritime hybrid activity from China, Iran, and Russia. <sup>57</sup>

Recent evidence also demonstrates Russian efforts to control the Northern Sea Route and gain exclusive access to its seabed mineral resources could also increase this region becoming a focal point for undersea cable conflict. Russia is backing building an extensive 14,000 kilometer/8,680 miles network of fiber optical cables along its northern littoral from Finland to Japan and including China, which will impact Moscow’s relations with the West and Beijing. This project is estimated to cost $800 million to $1.2 billion while providing data speeds of up to 200 terabytes per second. The Russian Government and Russian businesses do not currently possess necessary financial capitalization to build this and are seeking foreign investors through Scandinavia, Japanese, and one Russian company in the Arctic Connect consortium. Megafon, the Russian participant in Arctic Connect has close ties with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and Ministry of Defense. This project is expected to be completed by 2023 and would likely give the FSB the ability to monitor and read much data passing between Japan and Europe and incentivize Moscow to covertly install additional undersea cable systems, which could include sensing networks comparable to the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS) used by the U.S. Navy to support antisubmarine warfare and tactical forces by detecting, classifying, and providing timely information reporting on submarines and other contacts of interest. <sup>58</sup>

China is also heavily interested in undersea cables and this has been reflected in its business acquisition practices and military force development including deployment of 12 underwater drones in the Indian Ocean between December 2019-February 2020. Chinese tech companies like Huawei Marine Networks have laid 59,499 kilometers/36,488 miles of undersea cables in 98 projects encompassing the Indo-Pacific, South Pacific, and Atlantic regions. These firms have gone from 7% of undersea cable projects in 2012 to 20% in 2019. New Chinese fiber-optic submarine cables area supplemented by the 33-satellite Beidou Navigation Satellite System seeking to provide an alternative to U.S.-led Global Positioning Satellite and achieving global coverage by 2020. Beidou including Indonesia, Laos, Pakistan, and Thailand covers over 30 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries. China’s Digital Silk Road (DSR) also includes the Pakistan and East Africa (PEACE) Cable connecting Pakistan to Kenya with additional extension to France in 2021; a cable linking Cambodia and Hong-Kong; and the 25,000 km/15,500 mile Asia-AfricaEurope (AAE) cable involving China Unicom. Australia had to intervene to stop Beijing building an undersea cable to the Solomon Islands. <sup>59</sup>

Beijing’s increasing geopolitical assertiveness jeopardizes the undersea cable infrastructure of adjacent powers such as South Korea. China may use its increasing military power in undersea and other maritime domains and likely will engage in lawfare to engage in hostile attacks against undersea cables and promote its illicit undersea territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific region. This may be done through using People’s Liberation Army (PLAN) assets or using its maritime militia and fishing fleets to coerce countries and ships representing these countries requiring the use of undersea cables near China in order to engage in gray zone warfare against these countries to acquiesce in Beijing’s extraterritorial claims. Such behavior is ultimately consistent with the doctrine of unrestricted warfare espoused by the People’s Liberation Army to compensate for its perceived inferiority against the U.S. and its allies during a high technology war. <sup>60</sup>
