## Section 4 : The challenges of the US military existence in Iraq:
The existence of the US forces in Iraq with regard to the Iraqi situation faces challenges in the political and security fields, and although these challenges may affect the status of the US military existence, they may not be a basic reason for ending its existence in Iraq according to the directions of the US administration aiming for a long-term existence in Iraq. The challenges and obstacles facing the existence of US forces in Iraq can be summarized as follows:

1. Political challenges, represented by the rejection of the existence of the US military existence in Iraq and it has taken three levels, all of which are related to the Iranian influence on political life in Iraq through which Iran is working to find pressure papers on the United States of America to bargain in the field of its nuclear file and the US sanctions imposed on it, Often the voices rejecting the US existence in Iraq are affected by the level of the US-Iranian conflict, up and down, and perhaps these three levels of rejection are:

- The official level, and this official rejection of the US forces in Iraq came explicitly and took the form of an official procedure, especially after the targeting operation that was carried out by the US forces and affected Qassim Soleimani on January 3, 2020. Parliament in order to pass the necessary and urgent legislation to end the existence of foreign forces on Iraqi lands, and the Iraqi government considered that the country is facing two options: the first is to work to end the foreign military existence in Iraq urgently, and the second is to return to a previous draft resolution stipulating restrictions The tasks of the foreign forces in Iraq are to train and assist the Iraqi forces in the war against ISIS, so the first option was that which Adel Abdul Mahdi adopted, and the Iraqi Council of Representatives responded to the government's request and issued a decision on January 5, 2020 demanding the government to cancel the aid request submitted to the international coalition in 2016. To end the military operations to liberate Iraqi cities from ISIS control and work to end the foreign military existence on Iraqi lands, and to submit an official complaint to The Security Council against the United States of America for violating the sovereignty of Iraq (TRT Arabic, 2020). This decision sparked widespread controversy in Iraqi political circles because it was passed by Shiite representatives in the absence of representatives of Sunni and Kurdish political blocs and a number of representatives of other Shiite blocs that want a permanent American military existence in Iraq to balance Iranian influence.

- The Iraqi Prime Minister took another step when he submitted a request during his call with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on January 9, 2020 in line with the Iraqi parliament’s decision to withdraw troops from Iraq. Iraq, "and the response of the US State Department, according to her spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus," that any American delegation will not discuss the withdrawal of US forces because their existence in Iraq is appropriate, "while Trump's statement came through his interview with Fox News that:" If the race wants to leave the forces We will tell him you have to pay the money we paid, "referring to the money spent on building military bases in Iraq, while Pompeo held talks with his Canadian counterpart Francois Philippe Champaign about Iran and the opportunity to expand NATO's force in Iraq and share the burden appropriately. (Heavey, 2020)

- The level of political forces, the Iraqi political forces were divided into two directions in their stance towards the US military existence in Iraq, especially during the last two years when the controversy became clearer regarding the matter. The first trend aimed at removing these forces and ending their existence from the Iraqi arena is represented by a number of relevant political forces. The close connection with Iran, including the Badr Organization, the Supreme Islamic Council, League of the Righteous People, the Sadrist movement, and others. As for the second trend that wants the American forces to remain in Iraq, it is represented by a number of Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish political forces in general. The first trend goes that the survival of the American forces constitutes a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and must be ended. This development came after the expansion of the tasks of the American forces from training Iraqi forces to monitoring Iranian activities in Iraq, and the situation became more severe after the United States of America classified both the "Nujaba Movement" and " The Iranian Revolutionary Guard "is on the lists of terrorist organizations, while the second trend believes that the survival of the US forces in Iraq is a necessity to preserve stability and confront Iranian influence. (Ahmed, 2019) Despite the inability of the political forces that reject the American existence to end this existence, their position constitutes a political challenge to this existence in the Iraqi arena and cannot be ignored by the United States of America due to the role and influence of these forces in the political process and the Iraqi political decision.:

- The popular level, protests have been characterized by a popular character, although their motive is the political forces, demanding the departure of US forces from Iraq, and the protesters tried to storm the US embassy last January, and others like it sold the Sadrist movement on January 24 and raised slogans against the US military existence. And demanded to end his existence in Iraq. (Al-Yaqoubi, 2020)

2. Security challenges, the American bases and forces have been subjected to many threats and attacks, and perhaps the source of these threats is Iran, whether it was implemented directly or through its allies from the factions and armed groups in Iraq, and among the most prominent attacks on the US forces in Iraq are:

- An IED attack on US forces on October 1, 2017, in which an American soldier was killed and another was wounded. Desiring to get the US forces out of Iraq.

- A missile attack on “Ain Al-Asad base” on February 2, 2019, with three Katyusha rockets, which was thwarted by Iraqi forces based on US intelligence information.

- A missile attack on the "Qayyarah Air Force base" on February 12, 2019, when the base was attacked by three 107 mm rockets, and the US forces stated at the time that they had arrested individuals belonging to an Iranianbacked militia without announcing its name.

- An attack on the Taji camp on May 1, 2019, with two 107-caliber missiles, in which American forces are stationed to train Iraqi forces. The US forces say that members of the "Asaib Ahl al-Haq" movement were the ones that carried out the attack. (Knights, Responding to Iranian Harassment of US Facilities in Iraq, 2019)

- The American forces were attacked by Katyusha rockets in the presidential palaces in Mosul on June 19, 2019.

- The "Balad Air Force Base" was attacked with a number of mortar shells on July 15, 2019, and then it was attacked again with Katyusha rockets on December 5, 2019.

- The "Qayyarah Air Base" south of Mosul was attacked by a number of Katyusha rockets on November 8, 2019 (al-Din, 2019). Then it was bombed again when 5 shells fell on it on January 31, 2020, and the United States of America accused the Iraqi Hezbollah Brigades of these attacks. (thenewkhalij, 2020)

- Attacks on "K1 base" in Kirkuk, as the base was targeted with an attack with 30 rockets on December 27, 2019, and the second missile attack on the base was on February 13, 2020, and because of these attacks, the US forces responded with similar attacks on the headquarters and warehouses of the Iraqi Hezbollah Brigades, which killed 25 fighters in one attack. (thenewkhalij, 2020)

All that has been mentioned is missile attacks targeting US forces inside Iraq from parties considered by the United States of America to be Iran's armed proxies in Iraq. As for the threat that Iran carried out directly, it was manifested in the missile attack on the bases of "Ein Al-Asaad" in Anbar and "Harir" in Erbil. On January 8, 2020, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard targeted the two bases with ten medium-range ballistic missiles, and the attack came in the midst of the USIranian escalation in the Iraqi arena, which culminated in the US forces targeting the commander of the Iranian "Quds Corps" in Baghdad on January 3, 2020. The strike is revenge for the killing of Soleimani. (Rasanah, 2020)
